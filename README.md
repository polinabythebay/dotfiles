My dotfiles, yay!

What to do when I get a new machine to remind my future self:

- Install Sublime: https://www.sublimetext.com/3
- Install my favorite Terminal profile: http://color.smyck.org/
- Install Appleâ€™s Command Line Tools
  ```
  (Xcode is not required for working on a web app, but you still need to install the CLTs because other stuff might not work without it.)

  xcode-select --install

  If you get an error that the update is not available on the server, it may be because the CLTs are already installed. Check by using

  xcode-select -p
  ```
